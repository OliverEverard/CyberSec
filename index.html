      <p class="font px-2 py-2"> Current State of Cyber Security</p>
      <p class="bodyFont px-1 py-1"> 
        Currently, cyber threats are more prevalent than ever. 
        
        <br> 
        <br> 

        Much of this is due to the current situation in Ukraine, 
        as it has resulted in various governents pouring vast amounts of money into discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities, 
        as well as creating toolkits that can be used by bad actors to gain unauthorized access, and privileges to systems. 
      
        <br> 
        <br> 

        These developments then trickle down to the wider public, which is when they become an issue for us. 

        <br> 
        <br>

      <p class="font px-2 py-2"> Email and Social Engineering</p>
      <p class="bodyFont px-1 py-1"> 
        Social Engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. 
        Social Engineering attacks are still the most common causse of a breach, and Email is still the most common delivery method.  
        
        <br> 
        <br> 

        We are always improving our email security, but there will always be emails that slip through. 
        The main goal of most of these emails, is to obtain access to your credentials and your account, so it can be leveraged (using the afforementioned vulnerabilities / toolkits) 
        to gain more access to our systems. 
        
        <br>     
        <br> 

        If you are ever suspiscous of an email, please send it over so we can review it, and determine if it is legitimate. 
        Usually if something feels wrong with the email, there's a reason! 

        <br>     
        <br> 

        Some examples of what could make an email suspiscous are: 
        <br> 

            1. The [Possible Spam] Flag in the subject. 
            <br> 
            2. The sender address doesn't match what you expect
            <br> 
            3. Prompts to log into your microsoft account, or password reset emails
            <br> 
            4. Director impersonation emails, where you are given a number and told to call
          
        <br>     
        <br> 

        Due to this increased security, some legitimate emails will get falsely marked as malicous. This is innevitable, as thousands of emails can be blocked daily. 

        <br>     
        <br> 

        We have been manually reviewing the low-confidence blocks to try and reduce the impact, but please reach out if you are expecting an email you have not recieved.

        <p class="font px-2 py-2"> What are the goals of these bad actors? </p>
        <p class="bodyFont px-1 py-1"> 
            So once these people get a foot in the door, what do they want? 
            
            <br> 
            <br> 
    
            Currently, the most prevalant attack is Ransomware. This is so called as they stop you from accessing your files and systems, and then charge a large ransom 
            to give you control back. Even if you pay, there is no guarantee that you get the data back, or that it is not released to the public.  
            
            <br> 
            <br> 

            For example, Royal Mail recently had their data stolen, and it was released on the internet because they didn't pay up. 
            Other high profile examples in the last 7 days include 
            Ferrari, Staples, The Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, The FBI, and Hitachi Energy.
